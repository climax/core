You can think Climax as the "Electron for CLI applications". And in fact it does even a bit more than that:

- **CLI-based Development**<br>
  We provide a CLI allowing you to generate (almost) everything. Fun fact: the Climax CLI utilizes Climax. We do eat our own :hamburger:.<br>
- **Cross-Platform Build & Release**<br>
  Generate distribuable cross-platform builds in a matter of minutes with just a little bit of config.<br>
- **Auto-Update Feature**<br>
  Adding auto-update capabilities to your CLI clients has never been that easy: it is already implemented to work with your CI. And it's obviously fully secured.<br>
- **Conventions**<br>
  We provide a set of conventions regarding your CLI architecture in order to remove the pain of looking around for some.
